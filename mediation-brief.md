## A. Overview of the Case

This case presents a textbook example of workplace discrimination, harassment, and retaliation that culminated in the wrongful termination of a dedicated, long-tenured employee during her protected family medical leave to care for her dying father. Plaintiff **Fatima Diallo**, a Muslim African American woman, worked as a Personal Banker for Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. for more than **ten years** before being subjected to a relentless campaign of racial and religious harassment by her supervisor, Sergiy Vladychkin.[^1]

Despite Ms. Diallo's repeated complaints to Human Resources—**four separate complaints** documenting Vladychkin's discriminatory conduct—Wells Fargo took no action to investigate, remediate, or prevent the ongoing harassment.[^2] Instead, on **December 14, 2022**, while Ms. Diallo was on approved California Family Rights Act (CFRA) leave caring for her terminally ill father, Wells Fargo terminated her employment under shifting and contradictory pretexts.[^3] Her father passed away just **four days later** on December 18, 2022.[^4]

The circumstances of Ms. Diallo's termination—occurring **seven days** after she requested an extension of her CFRA leave—demonstrate clear retaliation for her exercise of protected rights and interference with her statutorily guaranteed family medical leave.[^5] The trauma of this wrongful termination, combined with the loss of her father and the years of harassment that preceded it, resulted in Ms. Diallo requiring **six to eight weeks of intensive psychiatric hospitalization** for severe emotional distress.[^6]

Ms. Diallo brings eleven causes of action against Wells Fargo and Vladychkin, arising under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), the California Family Rights Act (CFRA), and common law. This mediation brief demonstrates that Ms. Diallo has exceptionally strong claims on **all eleven causes of action**, supported by both direct and compelling circumstantial evidence of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and wrongful termination.

## B. Purposes of This Brief

This Confidential Mediation Brief is submitted to assist the mediator and the parties in understanding:

1. **The factual background** of Ms. Diallo's employment, the discrimination and harassment she endured, and the circumstances of her wrongful termination;

2. **The applicable legal standards** governing each of Ms. Diallo's eleven causes of action under FEHA, CFRA, and common law;

3. **The strength of Ms. Diallo's liability case**, including direct evidence of discrimination, powerful circumstantial evidence, extraordinary temporal proximity, and compelling pretext evidence;

4. **The extent of Ms. Diallo's damages**, including past and future economic losses, severe emotional distress requiring psychiatric hospitalization, and the basis for substantial punitive damages;

5. **The framework for settlement discussions**, including the substantial risks Wells Fargo faces at trial and the parameters for good-faith resolution;

6. **Ms. Diallo's trial readiness** and her commitment to achieving fair compensation either through negotiated settlement or jury verdict.

## C. Structure of This Brief

## D. The Human Story

Behind the legal claims and damage calculations is a deeply personal human story of injustice, betrayal, and profound loss.

**Fatima Diallo** is a Muslim African American woman who came to the United States seeking opportunity and a better life. She found employment at Wells Fargo in April 2012 as a Personal Banker and dedicated herself to the company for more than a decade.[^7] She served customers with professionalism and care, met her sales goals, and maintained positive relationships with colleagues.[^8]

In 2020, Ms. Diallo's employment took a dark turn when Sergiy Vladychkin became her supervisor. Vladychkin made no effort to hide his racist and discriminatory views. He openly stated that Black people—especially those of African descent like Ms. Diallo—are **"loud and not smart."**[^9] He told Ms. Diallo that he observed her praying during breaks and that he **"would never have hired"** her if he had known she was Muslim.[^10] These were not isolated comments; they were part of a pattern of harassment that made Ms. Diallo's workplace hostile and humiliating.

Ms. Diallo did what employees are supposed to do when faced with discrimination: **she reported it**. She filed complaints with Human Resources. She documented the harassment. She asked Wells Fargo to intervene and protect her rights.[^11] Wells Fargo did nothing. No investigation. No discipline for Vladychkin. No reassignment. No protection for Ms. Diallo. The company that held itself out as a leader in diversity and inclusion abandoned one of its employees when she needed support most.

In September 2022, Ms. Diallo faced every child's nightmare: her beloved father was diagnosed with a terminal illness. She requested CFRA leave to care for him in his final months, and Wells Fargo approved her leave on September 26, 2022.[^12] As her father's condition deteriorated, Ms. Diallo requested an extension of her leave on December 7, 2022.[^13]

One week later—on December 14, 2022—Wells Fargo terminated Ms. Diallo's employment.[^14] Not after her leave ended. Not after giving her an opportunity to return to work. **During her protected family medical leave, while she was caring for her dying father.**

Four days after her termination, on December 18, 2022, Ms. Diallo's father passed away.[^15] Instead of being able to focus entirely on comforting her father in his final days, Ms. Diallo was dealing with the shock, trauma, and financial panic of losing her job of more than ten years. Instead of mourning her father's death with the support of stable employment and health insurance, she was facing unemployment, mounting medical bills, and the psychological devastation of being cast aside by the employer to whom she had dedicated a decade of her professional life.

The impact on Ms. Diallo's mental health was catastrophic. She required **six to eight weeks of intensive psychiatric hospitalization** to address the severe emotional trauma.[^16] More than two years later, she continues to suffer from anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress.[^17] The psychological scars of this betrayal will likely remain with her for the rest of her life.

This is not just a case about legal violations and damage calculations. **This is a case about a woman who played by the rules, worked hard, reported discrimination, and was punished for it.** It is a case about a daughter who should have been allowed to care for her dying father without fear of losing her livelihood. It is a case about a corporation that valued convenience over compassion, profit over principle, and expediency over employee rights.

Ms. Diallo comes to mediation seeking justice—not just for herself, but to send a message that employees have rights that must be respected, that discrimination and harassment will not be tolerated, and that retaliation against those who speak up will carry consequences.

## E. Why This Case Is Exceptionally Strong

While every case has some uncertainties, Ms. Diallo's case presents an unusually compelling set of facts and legal claims. Several features make this case particularly strong:

**1. Direct Evidence of Discrimination**

Most employment discrimination cases rely entirely on circumstantial evidence—patterns of treatment, statistical comparisons, or suspicious timing. This case is different. **Ms. Diallo has direct evidence of both racial and religious discrimination** through Vladychkin's explicit discriminatory statements.[^18] This direct evidence allows Ms. Diallo to bypass the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework and proceed directly to proving that discrimination was a motivating factor in her termination.[^19]

**2. Termination During Protected Leave**

Wells Fargo terminated Ms. Diallo **during** her approved CFRA leave—not before it began, not after it ended, but while she was actively on protected leave.[^20] This timing constitutes *prima facie* evidence of CFRA interference and demonstrates callous disregard for Ms. Diallo's statutory rights.

**3. Extraordinary Temporal Proximity**

The termination occurred just **seven days** after Ms. Diallo requested an extension of her CFRA leave.[^21] California courts recognize that temporal proximity alone can establish causation for retaliation claims, and a seven-day gap is extraordinarily close.[^22] This timing creates a powerful inference that the leave extension request directly motivated the termination decision.

**4. Multiple Ignored Complaints**

Ms. Diallo filed **four separate HR complaints** about Vladychkin's discrimination and harassment.[^23] Wells Fargo's complete failure to investigate or respond to these complaints demonstrates both independent liability for failure to prevent harassment and corporate ratification of Vladychkin's discriminatory conduct supporting punitive damages.[^24]

**5. Shifting and Contradictory Explanations**

Wells Fargo issued **three different termination letters** with contradictory explanations for Ms. Diallo's discharge.[^25] These shifting justifications—each differing from the last—constitute powerful evidence of pretext and suggest that the true reason for termination was unlawful discrimination or retaliation.[^26]

**6. Severe and Documented Harm**

Unlike cases where emotional distress is difficult to quantify or verify, Ms. Diallo's harm is both **severe and objectively documented**. She required six to eight weeks of intensive psychiatric hospitalization—a level of care reserved for the most serious mental health crises.[^27] This objective evidence of harm will resonate powerfully with a jury and supports substantial damages.

**7. Ten-Year Tenure**

Ms. Diallo was not a short-term or probationary employee. She worked for Wells Fargo for **more than a decade**, demonstrating loyalty, competence, and value to the organization.[^28] The termination of a long-tenured employee under suspicious circumstances will strike a jury as particularly unjust.

**8. Sympathetic Plaintiff**

Ms. Diallo is a highly sympathetic plaintiff: a hardworking employee, a caring daughter who took leave to support her dying father, a woman who experienced discrimination based on multiple protected characteristics, and a person who suffered documented severe emotional harm. She will connect with jurors on a human level.

**9. Corporate Defendant with Deep Pockets**

Wells Fargo is one of the largest banks in the United States with billions of dollars in annual revenue.[^29] Juries are historically less sympathetic to large corporate defendants in employment cases, particularly when the corporation has substantial resources to ensure compliance with civil rights laws but failed to do so. Wells Fargo's wealth also supports higher punitive damages to achieve meaningful deterrence.

**10. Violation of Fundamental Rights**

This case involves violations of some of California's most fundamental employee protections: the right to a workplace free from discrimination and harassment, the right to take protected family medical leave, and the right to report violations without retaliation. These rights are enshrined in California public policy and protected by robust statutory schemes. Juries understand and value these protections.

## F. Approach to Mediation

Ms. Diallo approaches this mediation with a genuine desire to resolve this matter fairly and avoid the emotional toll of a trial. While she is confident in the strength of her case and fully prepared to proceed to trial, she recognizes that settlement offers benefits to both parties:

- **Certainty**: Avoiding the inherent unpredictability of jury verdicts
- **Efficiency**: Resolving the matter without years of additional litigation and appeals
- **Privacy**: Maintaining confidentiality rather than public trial testimony
- **Control**: Participating in crafting the resolution rather than leaving it entirely to a jury
- **Closure**: Achieving finality and allowing Ms. Diallo to move forward with her life

However, Ms. Diallo **will not settle for less than fair value** simply to avoid trial. She has suffered severe harm—economic, emotional, and reputational. She has been deprived of her livelihood, her health insurance, her retirement contributions, and her peace of mind. She has been subjected to years of harassment and discrimination, culminating in a termination so egregious in its timing that it shocks the conscience.

**Ms. Diallo is entitled to full and fair compensation for these harms, and she will insist upon it—whether through settlement or trial verdict.**

This brief demonstrates why Ms. Diallo's case is exceptionally strong, why her damages are substantial, and why settlement within the ranges discussed herein represents a prudent resolution for Wells Fargo. Ms. Diallo looks forward to productive mediation discussions and hopes that Wells Fargo will approach this process with the seriousness and good faith it deserves.

# III. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

The legal standards governing this employment discrimination and retaliation case are well-established under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), the California Family Rights Act (CFRA), and California common law. This section sets forth the essential elements of each cause of action and the applicable burdens of proof.

## A. FEHA Discrimination (Gov. Code § 12940(a))

Under CACI No. 2500, to prevail on a claim of discrimination in violation of FEHA, Plaintiff must prove all of the following elements:[^30]

1. Plaintiff was an employee of Defendant Wells Fargo;
2. Defendant Wells Fargo was Plaintiff's employer;
3. Plaintiff's **religious creed**, **race**, **national origin**, and/or **association with a disabled family member** was a motivating reason for Defendant's decision to terminate her employment;
4. Plaintiff was harmed; and
5. Defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff's harm.

FEHA prohibits discrimination on numerous protected bases, including race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, and military and veteran status.[^31] The statute also prohibits discrimination based on a person's association with someone who has, or is perceived to have, any of these characteristics.[^32]

**Causation Standard**: Plaintiff need only show that her protected characteristic was "a motivating reason" for the adverse employment action, not the sole or even primary reason.[^33] This is a lower standard than "but-for" causation and recognizes that employment decisions are often based on multiple factors.

## B. FEHA Hostile Work Environment Harassment (Gov. Code § 12940(j))

Under CACI No. 2521A-C, to establish a hostile work environment harassment claim, Plaintiff must prove:[^34]

1. Plaintiff was subjected to unwanted harassing conduct because of her **religious creed** and/or **race/national origin**;
2. The harassing conduct was **severe or pervasive**;
3. A reasonable person in Plaintiff's position would have considered the work environment hostile or abusive;
4. Plaintiff considered the work environment hostile or abusive;
5. Defendant is responsible for that work environment;
6. Plaintiff was harmed; and
7. The hostile work environment was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff's harm.

**Severe or Pervasive Standard**: The harassment need not be both severe *and* pervasive—it can be either severe *or* pervasive to meet the legal standard.[^35] Courts evaluate the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.[^36]

**Objective and Subjective Tests**: The harassment must satisfy both an objective test (whether a reasonable person would find the environment hostile) and a subjective test (whether the plaintiff actually perceived it as hostile).[^37]

## C. FEHA Retaliation (Gov. Code § 12940(h))

Under CACI No. 2505, to prove retaliation in violation of FEHA, Plaintiff must establish:[^38]

1. Plaintiff engaged in a protected activity;
2. Defendant subjected Plaintiff to an adverse employment action;
3. Plaintiff's protected activity was a substantial motivating reason for Defendant's adverse action;
4. Plaintiff was harmed; and
5. Defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff's harm.

**Protected Activities** include:[^39]
- Opposing practices forbidden under FEHA (such as discrimination or harassment);
- Filing a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department (CRD, formerly DFEH);
- Testifying, assisting, or participating in any investigation, proceeding, or hearing under FEHA.

**Causation Standard**: The protected activity must be a "substantial motivating reason" for the adverse action, but again, need not be the sole or but-for cause.[^40]

## D. Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Harassment (Gov. Code § 12940(k))

Under CACI No. 2527, to establish this claim, Plaintiff must prove:[^41]

1. Defendant was Plaintiff's employer;
2. Plaintiff was subjected to discrimination or harassment by employees or non-employees;
3. Defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination or harassment;
4. Plaintiff was harmed; and
5. Defendant's failure to take all reasonable steps was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff's harm.

**Reasonable Steps** include implementing anti-discrimination policies, providing training to supervisors and employees, establishing an effective complaint procedure, conducting prompt and thorough investigations, and taking appropriate corrective action.[^42]

## E. Failure to Accommodate Disability (Gov. Code § 12940(m))

Under CACI No. 2541, Plaintiff may establish failure to accommodate based on her father's disability (associational disability discrimination):[^43]

1. Plaintiff's family member (father) had a physical or mental disability;
2. Defendant knew of the disability;
3. Plaintiff could perform her essential duties with reasonable accommodation (e.g., extended CFRA leave);
4. Defendant failed to provide reasonable accommodation;
5. Plaintiff was harmed; and
6. Defendant's failure was a substantial factor in causing harm.

**Reasonable Accommodation** can include job restructuring, modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, leave of absence, or adjustment of policies to permit necessary leave for family care.[^44]

## F. Failure to Engage in Interactive Process (Gov. Code § 12940(n))

Under CACI No. 2546, to prove failure to engage in the interactive process:[^45]

1. Plaintiff's family member had a physical or mental disability;
2. Defendant knew of the disability;
3. Plaintiff requested reasonable accommodation OR Defendant had notice that accommodation was needed;
4. Defendant failed to engage in a timely, good faith interactive process;
5. Reasonable accommodation was available that would not impose undue hardship on Defendant;
6. Plaintiff was harmed by loss of an employment benefit (e.g., her job); and
7. Defendant's failure to engage in the interactive process was a substantial factor in causing harm.

**Interactive Process Requirements**: The employer must respond promptly to accommodation requests, engage in good faith communication with the employee, explore available accommodation options, and document the interactive process.[^46] Failure to engage in this process, even if a reasonable accommodation was not ultimately available, can constitute a separate violation.

## G. CFRA Interference (Gov. Code § 12945.2)

The California Family Rights Act entitles eligible employees to up to 12 weeks of protected leave for serious health conditions affecting the employee or a qualifying family member.[^47] To establish CFRA interference, Plaintiff must prove:[^48]

1. Plaintiff was eligible for CFRA leave (employed 12+ months, worked 1,250+ hours in the previous 12 months);
2. Plaintiff was entitled to leave for a qualifying reason (caring for her father with a serious health condition);
3. Plaintiff provided notice to her employer of her need for CFRA leave;
4. Defendant denied or interfered with Plaintiff's CFRA rights, including her right to reinstatement to the same or a comparable position.

**Notice Standard**: An employee need not expressly assert rights under CFRA or even mention "CFRA" by name. Verbal notice sufficient to make the employer aware that the employee needs CFRA leave, along with anticipated timing and duration, satisfies the notice requirement.[^49] If the notice is ambiguous, the employer has a duty to inquire further to determine whether the employee is requesting CFRA leave.[^50]

**Employer Obligations**: Upon receiving notice of a need for leave, the employer must provide the employee with eligibility and rights/responsibilities notices within five business days.[^51] Failure to provide timely notice can constitute interference with CFRA rights.

## H. CFRA Retaliation (Gov. Code § 12945.2(l))

To prove CFRA retaliation, Plaintiff must establish:[^52]

1. Plaintiff took CFRA leave or requested CFRA leave;
2. Defendant took an adverse employment action (termination);
3. There was a causal connection between Plaintiff's leave/leave request and the adverse action.

**Temporal Proximity**: When an adverse employment action occurs shortly after an employee takes or requests CFRA leave, temporal proximity alone can establish the causal connection and support an inference of retaliation.[^53] Courts have found temporal proximity highly probative when the adverse action occurs within days or weeks of the protected activity.[^54]

## I. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy

Under CACI No. 2430, to prove common law wrongful termination, Plaintiff must establish:[^55]

1. Defendant employed Plaintiff;
2. Plaintiff was discharged;
3. The discharge violated public policy; and
4. The discharge caused Plaintiff harm.

**Public Policy Sources**: Public policy may be derived from constitutional provisions, statutes (such as FEHA and CFRA), administrative regulations, or case law establishing fundamental public policy.[^56] Terminating an employee for exercising statutory rights under FEHA or CFRA violates fundamental California public policy.

## J. Burden of Proof and Evidentiary Standards

### 1. Preponderance of the Evidence (CACI No. 200)

For all elements of Plaintiff's FEHA, CFRA, and wrongful termination claims, the burden of proof is by a **preponderance of the evidence**.[^57] This means evidence that has more convincing force than the evidence opposed to it—in other words, evidence showing that something is more likely true than not true (greater than 50% probability).[^58]

If the evidence is so evenly balanced that the factfinder cannot determine that the evidence on either side preponderates, the finding on that issue must be against the party who had the burden of proving it.[^59]

### 2. Clear and Convincing Evidence (CACI No. 201)

For **punitive damages** under FEHA, Plaintiff must prove by **clear and convincing evidence** that Defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud.[^60] Clear and convincing evidence is "evidence of such convincing force that it causes [the factfinder] to believe that it is highly probable that the fact is true."[^61] This is a more stringent standard than preponderance of the evidence, though not as high as proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Malice, Oppression, or Fraud Defined**:[^62]
- **Malice**: Conduct intended to cause injury to the plaintiff, or despicable conduct carried on with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
- **Oppression**: Despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights.
- **Fraud**: An intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact with the intention of depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.

**Employer Liability for Punitive Damages**: To hold an employer liable for punitive damages, the wrongful conduct must have been committed, authorized, or ratified by an officer, director, or managing agent of the employer.[^63]

### 3. McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting Framework (CACI No. 2507)

In cases where direct evidence of discrimination is unavailable, California courts apply the three-stage burden-shifting framework established in *McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green*, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), and adopted by California in *Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc.*, 24 Cal.4th 317 (2000):[^64]

**Stage 1**: Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation by showing:
- (a) She belongs to a protected class or engaged in protected activity;
- (b) She was qualified for the position and performing competently;
- (c) She suffered an adverse employment action; and
- (d) Circumstances suggest a discriminatory or retaliatory motive.

**Stage 2**: Once the prima facie case is established, the burden shifts to Defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory or non-retaliatory reason for the adverse action.

**Stage 3**: If Defendant meets its burden, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to prove that Defendant's stated reason is pretextual (a cover-up for the true discriminatory or retaliatory motive).

**Direct Evidence Exception**: If Plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination or retaliation (e.g., explicit discriminatory or retaliatory statements by a decision-maker), the McDonnell Douglas framework does not apply, and Plaintiff may proceed directly to prove that discrimination or retaliation was a substantial motivating factor.[^65]

## K. Temporal Proximity as Evidence of Causation

California courts recognize that **close temporal proximity** between protected activity (such as requesting or taking protected leave) and an adverse employment action can, by itself, establish the causal link required for retaliation claims.[^66]

Case law demonstrates that temporal proximity is highly probative:
- Adverse action within **6-13 days** of protected activity has been deemed strong evidence of causation.[^67]
- Adverse action within **several weeks** of protected activity creates an inference of retaliation sufficient to survive summary judgment.[^68]
- The closer in time the adverse action follows the protected activity, the stronger the inference of a causal connection.[^69]

In this case, Wells Fargo terminated Ms. Diallo on December 14, 2022, **while she was on approved CFRA leave** and only **67 days after her leave was approved** on September 26, 2022. This extraordinarily close temporal proximity powerfully supports an inference of unlawful retaliation and interference.

# IV. ANALYSIS OF LIABILITY

Plaintiff's claims against Wells Fargo and Vladychkin are exceptionally strong. Each of the eleven causes of action is supported by overwhelming evidence, including direct evidence of discrimination and harassment, powerful circumstantial evidence, and compelling temporal proximity between Ms. Diallo's protected activities and her termination. This section analyzes each claim and demonstrates why liability is clear.

## A. First Cause of Action: Race, National Origin, and Color Discrimination (FEHA § 12940(a))

Ms. Diallo can easily establish her prima facie case for race, national origin, and color discrimination under FEHA.[^70]

### 1. Prima Facie Case

**Element 1: Protected Class Membership** – Ms. Diallo is a Muslim African American woman, making her a member of multiple protected classes based on race, national origin, and color.[^71]

**Element 2: Employer-Employee Relationship** – Wells Fargo was Ms. Diallo's employer for over ten years, from April 16, 2012, until her termination in December 2022.[^72]

**Element 3: Race Was a Motivating Reason** – Ms. Diallo's race and national origin were substantial motivating reasons for her termination and the adverse treatment she endured throughout her employment.[^73]

**Element 4: Plaintiff Was Harmed** – Ms. Diallo suffered severe economic and emotional harm as a result of her termination, including loss of wages, loss of employment benefits, and severe emotional distress requiring 6-8 weeks of inpatient mental health treatment.[^74]

**Element 5: Substantial Factor Causation** – Defendants' discriminatory conduct was a substantial factor in causing Ms. Diallo's harm.[^75]

### 2. Direct Evidence of Racial Discrimination

Ms. Diallo's case is strengthened by **direct evidence** of racial discrimination—explicit discriminatory statements by her supervisor, Vladychkin. Vladychkin repeatedly made overtly racist comments about people of African descent, stating that Black people, and especially those of African descent, are **"loud and not smart."**[^76] When Ms. Diallo would demonstrate knowledge about a subject, Vladychkin would respond with sarcastic surprise, expressing disbelief that an African woman could be intelligent or knowledgeable.[^77]

These explicit statements eliminate the need for the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. As the California Court of Appeal explained in *Wallace v. County of Stanislaus*, when a plaintiff presents direct evidence of discriminatory animus, such evidence "speaks for itself" and obviates the need for circumstantial proof through the burden-shifting framework.[^78]

### 3. Pretext Evidence

Even if Wells Fargo attempts to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Ms. Diallo's termination, the evidence of pretext is overwhelming:

**Suspicious Timing**: Ms. Diallo was terminated on December 14, 2022, while she was on **approved CFRA leave** caring for her dying father.[^79] The temporal proximity between her protected leave and her termination—occurring *during* her leave—is highly probative of discriminatory and retaliatory intent.[^80]

**Shifting and Inconsistent Explanations**: Wells Fargo's personnel file contains **three different termination letters** with **three different effective dates**: October 31, 2022, December 6, 2022, and December 15, 2022.[^81] As California courts have recognized, shifting or inconsistent explanations for an adverse employment action are powerful evidence of pretext, because "one who tells the truth need not recite different versions of supposedly the same event."[^82]

**Performance History Contradicts Stated Reason**: Ms. Diallo's 2022 Mid-Year Performance Review praised her performance, noting that she "shines" in customer experience and teamwork and is "always offering her help and support."[^83] Vladychkin himself acknowledged that he heard "nothing but positive things from the leadership" of the other branches Ms. Diallo assisted.[^84] This exemplary performance record directly contradicts any claim that her termination was performance-based.

**Lack of Notice and Due Process**: Ms. Diallo was never informed of her termination while on leave. She only discovered she had been terminated when she returned to the United States in January 2023 and contacted Human Resources.[^85] Wells Fargo's failure to provide any notice, explanation, or opportunity to respond demonstrates the pretextual nature of the termination.

### 4. Employer's Failure to Investigate Complaints

Ms. Diallo made **at least four complaints** to Wells Fargo Human Resources regarding Vladychkin's harassment and discrimination.[^86] Wells Fargo failed to produce any findings or resolutions in response to any of her complaints.[^87] This failure to investigate or remedy known discrimination further demonstrates Wells Fargo's discriminatory animus and ratification of Vladychkin's conduct.

---

## B. Second Cause of Action: Religious Creed Discrimination (FEHA § 12940(a))

Ms. Diallo's religious discrimination claim is equally compelling and supported by direct evidence of discriminatory animus.

### 1. Prima Facie Case

Ms. Diallo can establish all elements of religious discrimination under CACI No. 2500:

**Protected Religious Practice**: As a practicing Muslim, Ms. Diallo is required by her faith to pray five times per day.[^88] This is a sincere religious practice protected under FEHA.

**Employer Knowledge**: Vladychkin was fully aware of Ms. Diallo's Islamic religious practices. He observed her praying and questioned her about it repeatedly.[^89]

**Discrimination and Failure to Accommodate**: Rather than accommodating Ms. Diallo's religious practice by providing a designated prayer space (as supervisors at other Wells Fargo branches did),[^90] Vladychkin refused to provide any accommodation, forcing Ms. Diallo to pray in the women's restroom to avoid his harassment.[^91]

### 2. Direct Evidence of Religious Discrimination

Vladychkin made numerous explicit discriminatory statements about Ms. Diallo's Islamic faith:

- He condescendingly referred to her sacred prayer practice as her **"thing"**[^92]
- He repeatedly questioned her religious observance, asking **"Why do you have to pray five times a day? Other Muslims don't practice like that…you are too religious."**[^93]
- During Ramadan, when Ms. Diallo covered her hair in observance of the holiest month in Islam, Vladychkin questioned the need for this religious practice.[^94]
- After Ms. Diallo returned from a prayer session, Vladychkin stated: **"If I had interviewed you, I would never have hired you."**[^95]

This last statement is particularly damning—it constitutes direct evidence that Vladychkin's employment decisions were motivated by Ms. Diallo's religious practices. It shows that but for her religious observance, Vladychkin would not have hired her, and by extension, that her religion was a motivating factor in her termination.

### 3. Denial of Religious Accommodation

Under FEHA, employers must provide reasonable accommodation for religious practices unless doing so would impose an undue hardship.[^96] Providing Ms. Diallo with a private space for prayer—something other Wells Fargo branches readily provided—would have imposed no hardship whatsoever on Wells Fargo.[^97]

Vladychkin's refusal to accommodate Ms. Diallo's religious practice, coupled with his harassment of her for engaging in that practice, constitutes clear religious discrimination and failure to accommodate under California Government Code § 12940(l).

---

## C. Third Cause of Action: Associational Disability Discrimination (FEHA § 12940(a); § 12926(o))

California law prohibits discrimination based on a person's association with someone who has, or is perceived to have, a disability.[^98]

### 1. Prima Facie Case

**Element 1: Family Member with Disability** – Ms. Diallo's father suffered from terminal colon cancer, a serious medical condition that limited his major life activities and constituted a physical disability.[^99]

**Element 2: Employer Knowledge** – Wells Fargo had actual knowledge of Ms. Diallo's father's disability. She formally requested CFRA leave to care for him, and Lincoln Financial Group (Wells Fargo's disability claims administrator) approved her leave specifically to care for her father with a serious health condition.[^100]

**Element 3: Adverse Action Based on Association** – Wells Fargo terminated Ms. Diallo on December 14, 2022, while she was on approved leave caring for her disabled father.[^101] The termination occurred **four days before her father died** on December 18, 2022.[^102]

**Element 4: Nexus Between Association and Termination** – The temporal proximity is stark: Ms. Diallo's employment was terminated *while she was actively caring for her terminally ill father*. This close connection between her associational relationship with a disabled person and the adverse action establishes the required nexus.

### 2. Employer Motive for Associational Discrimination

Wells Fargo had multiple unlawful motives for discriminating against Ms. Diallo based on her father's disability:

**Fear of Ongoing Absences**: Ms. Diallo's request on December 7, 2022, to extend her leave because her father was in hospice care and had only days to live[^103] signaled to Wells Fargo that she might need additional time off. Rather than engage in the interactive process or grant additional leave, Wells Fargo terminated her employment one week later.

**Cost Concerns**: Employers sometimes discriminate against employees with disabled family members out of concern that the employee's attention will be diverted from work, or that the employer will incur costs associated with family medical leave.[^104] Wells Fargo's decision to terminate Ms. Diallo during her approved CFRA leave—rather than allowing her to return after the leave period—suggests such improper cost-based motivations.

---

## D. Fourth Cause of Action: Hostile Work Environment Harassment (FEHA § 12940(j))

Ms. Diallo's hostile work environment claim satisfies all elements under CACI No. 2521A.

### 1. Elements of Hostile Work Environment

**Element 1: Unwelcome Harassment Based on Protected Characteristics** – Ms. Diallo was subjected to persistent, unwelcome harassment by her direct supervisor based on her race, national origin, and religious creed. The harassment included:

- Racist statements that people of African descent are "loud and not smart"[^105]
- Mocking and questioning her Islamic prayer practices
- Condescending surprise when she demonstrated knowledge
- Denial of religious accommodation
- Statement that he would never have hired her because of her religious practices[^106]

**Element 2: Severe or Pervasive** – The harassment was both severe and pervasive. It occurred throughout Ms. Diallo's employment at the San Francisco branch under Vladychkin's supervision, involved her direct supervisor (a person with authority over her daily work and employment status), and targeted fundamental aspects of her identity—her race, ethnicity, and deeply held religious beliefs.[^107]

The California Supreme Court has made clear that harassment need not be both severe *and* pervasive—it can be either.[^108] Here, Vladychkin's harassment easily satisfies both standards.

**Element 3: Objective Hostility** – A reasonable person in Ms. Diallo's position would have found the work environment hostile, intimidating, and oppressive. Being told repeatedly by one's supervisor that people of your race are unintelligent, being mocked for your religious practices, and being forced to pray in a bathroom to avoid harassment would be offensive and abusive to any reasonable person.

**Element 4: Subjective Perception** – Ms. Diallo actually perceived the environment as hostile. The harassment caused her extreme discomfort and distress, ultimately contributing to her need for intensive mental health treatment.[^109]

**Element 5: Employer Responsibility** – Vladychkin was Ms. Diallo's direct supervisor with authority over her day-to-day work and personnel decisions.[^110] Under FEHA, employers are strictly liable for harassment by supervisors.[^111]

**Element 6: Harm** – The hostile work environment caused Ms. Diallo severe emotional distress, requiring 6-8 weeks of inpatient treatment at John Muir Behavioral Center.[^112]

**Element 7: Substantial Factor** – The hostile work environment was a substantial factor in causing Ms. Diallo's emotional and economic harm.

### 2. Wells Fargo's Knowledge and Failure to Act

Ms. Diallo made **at least four complaints** to Wells Fargo Human Resources about Vladychkin's harassment.[^113] Despite these repeated complaints, Wells Fargo failed to investigate, failed to take any corrective action, and ultimately terminated Ms. Diallo while she was on protected leave.[^114] This failure to respond to known harassment constitutes ratification of Vladychkin's conduct and independent grounds for employer liability.

---

## E. Fifth Cause of Action: FEHA Retaliation (Gov. Code § 12940(h))

Ms. Diallo's retaliation claim is supported by both her complaints about harassment and her exercise of CFRA leave rights.

### 1. Prima Facie Case (CACI No. 2505)

**Element 1: Protected Activity** – Ms. Diallo engaged in multiple protected activities:

- She made at least four formal complaints to Wells Fargo Human Resources about Vladychkin's discrimination and harassment[^115]
- She requested and took CFRA leave to care for her father with a serious health condition[^116]
- She requested an extension of her CFRA leave when her father entered hospice care[^117]

**Element 2: Adverse Employment Action** – Wells Fargo terminated Ms. Diallo's employment on December 14, 2022.[^118]

**Element 3: Causal Connection** – The causal connection is overwhelming:

**Temporal Proximity**: Ms. Diallo requested a leave extension on December 7, 2022, explaining that her father was in hospice with only days to live.[^119] **Seven days later**, Wells Fargo terminated her employment.[^120] California courts have consistently held that adverse actions occurring within days or weeks of protected activity create a strong inference of retaliation.[^121]

**Pattern of Ignoring Requests**: After Ms. Diallo requested a leave extension, Vladychkin never responded to her request, despite initially expressing "support."[^122] When her father died on December 18, 2022, she informed Vladychkin, who again expressed "support" but provided no information about her employment status or leave extension.[^123] Ms. Diallo followed up twice more (January 9 and January 19, 2023) requesting an update, and Vladychkin did not reply to either message.[^124] This pattern of silence and evasion demonstrates consciousness of wrongdoing.

**Element 4: Harm** – Ms. Diallo suffered severe economic and emotional harm from the termination.

**Element 5: Substantial Factor** – The protected activities were substantial motivating factors for the termination.

### 2. Direct Evidence of Retaliatory Motive

The timing alone is direct evidence of retaliation: Ms. Diallo was terminated *while on approved protected leave* and only days after requesting an extension due to her father's imminent death. This is precisely the type of retaliation FEHA prohibits—punishing an employee for exercising her legal right to family medical leave.

---

## F. Sixth Cause of Action: Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Harassment (Gov. Code § 12940(k))

### 1. Elements Under CACI No. 2527

**Element 1: Employer-Employee Relationship** – Wells Fargo was Ms. Diallo's employer.[^125]

**Element 2: Subjected to Discrimination or Harassment** – As detailed above, Ms. Diallo was subjected to severe and pervasive discrimination and harassment based on her race, national origin, and religious creed by her supervisor, Vladychkin.[^126]

**Element 3: Failure to Take Reasonable Steps** – Wells Fargo failed to take *any* reasonable steps to prevent the discrimination and harassment despite having actual knowledge of it.[^127]

Ms. Diallo made at least four separate complaints to Human Resources.[^128] Wells Fargo's response was complete inaction—no investigation, no findings, no corrective measures, no discipline of Vladychkin.[^129] This failure to respond to known harassment constitutes a failure to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment.

**Element 4: Harm and Causation** – Wells Fargo's failure to prevent discrimination and harassment was a substantial factor in causing Ms. Diallo's harm.

### 2. Employer's Duty to Prevent

California employers have an affirmative duty to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination and harassment.[^130] Reasonable steps include:

- Implementing effective anti-harassment policies
- Providing training to supervisors and employees
- Establishing accessible complaint procedures
- Promptly investigating complaints
- Taking appropriate corrective action[^131]

Wells Fargo failed at every step. Despite multiple complaints, Wells Fargo took no action whatsoever, allowing Vladychkin's harassment to continue unchecked.

---

## G. Seventh Cause of Action: CFRA Interference (Gov. Code § 12945.2)

### 1. CFRA Interference Elements

**Element 1: Eligibility for CFRA Leave** – Ms. Diallo was employed by Wells Fargo for over ten years and worked well in excess of 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding her leave request.[^132] She was unquestionably eligible for CFRA leave.

**Element 2: Entitlement to Leave for Qualifying Reason** – Ms. Diallo's father had terminal colon cancer, a serious health condition.[^133] Caring for a parent with a serious health condition is a qualifying reason for CFRA leave under California Government Code § 12945.2(b)(5)(B).

**Element 3: Notice to Employer** – Ms. Diallo provided proper notice. She formally requested leave through Lincoln Financial Group, Wells Fargo's disability administrator, which approved her CFRA leave on September 26, 2022.[^134] Under California law, verbal notice is sufficient, and an employee need not even mention "CFRA" by name.[^135]

**Element 4: Interference with CFRA Rights** – Wells Fargo directly interfered with Ms. Diallo's CFRA rights by:

- Terminating her employment on December 14, 2022, **while she was on approved CFRA leave**[^136]
- Failing to respond to her request for a leave extension made on December 7, 2022[^137]
- Denying her the right to reinstatement to the same or comparable position upon completion of her leave
- Failing to provide the statutorily required guarantee of employment[^138]

### 2. Violation of CFRA's Core Protection

CFRA's central protection is the right to take up to 12 weeks of leave *and* the guarantee of reinstatement to the same or a comparable position.[^139] California law expressly states that leave "shall not be deemed to have been granted unless the employer provides the employee, upon granting the leave request, **a guarantee of employment in the same or a comparable position upon the termination of the leave.**"[^140]

Wells Fargo not only failed to guarantee Ms. Diallo's reinstatement—it terminated her employment *during* her protected leave, in flagrant violation of CFRA.

### 3. Employer's Prohibited Conduct During Leave

Wells Fargo's internal leave approval letter from Lincoln Financial Group explicitly instructed Vladychkin to "[r]eview all communications related to [their] employee's leave and perform any actions as requested as soon as possible" and stated in all capital letters: **"DO NOT TAKE ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION OR REPLACE THE EMPLOYEE'S POSITION UNTIL CONSULTING WITH ER SOLUTIONS FIRST."**[^141]

Despite this explicit warning, Wells Fargo terminated Ms. Diallo's employment while she was on approved leave. This constitutes willful interference with CFRA rights.

---

## H. Eighth Cause of Action: CFRA Retaliation (Gov. Code § 12945.2(l))

### 1. CFRA Retaliation Elements

**Element 1: Exercise of CFRA Rights** – Ms. Diallo took approved CFRA leave beginning October 8, 2022, to care for her father with terminal cancer.[^142] On December 7, 2022, she requested an extension of her leave because her father was in hospice care.[^143]

**Element 2: Adverse Employment Action** – Wells Fargo terminated Ms. Diallo's employment on December 14, 2022.[^144]

**Element 3: Causal Connection** – The causal connection is overwhelming:

**Temporal Proximity**: Ms. Diallo was terminated only **seven days** after requesting a leave extension and **while still on approved CFRA leave**.[^145] California courts have held that temporal proximity of days or weeks creates a strong inference of retaliation, and here the adverse action occurred *during* the protected leave itself.

**Direct Nexus**: The termination occurred in direct response to Ms. Diallo's exercise of her CFRA rights. She was not terminated before taking leave, nor was she terminated after her scheduled return date. She was terminated *while actively exercising her CFRA rights*, demonstrating a direct nexus between the protected activity and the adverse action.

### 2. Presumption of Causation from Temporal Proximity

"The close temporal proximity alone of Plaintiff's CFRA request to Defendant's termination of her employment creates a presumption of a causal connection between Plaintiff's protected activities and Defendants' adverse employment actions against her."[^146] Here, the termination didn't just follow the CFRA leave request—it occurred *during* the CFRA leave, making the causal connection even more evident.

---

## I. Ninth Cause of Action: Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy (Tameny Claim)

### 1. Elements Under CACI No. 2430

**Element 1: Employment Relationship** – Wells Fargo employed Ms. Diallo for over ten years.[^147]

**Element 2: Discharge** – Wells Fargo terminated Ms. Diallo's employment on December 14, 2022.[^148]

**Element 3: Violation of Public Policy** – The termination violated fundamental public policies embodied in FEHA and CFRA, which prohibit:

- Discrimination based on race, national origin, color, and religious creed
- Harassment based on protected characteristics
- Retaliation for opposing unlawful practices
- Interference with family medical leave rights
- Retaliation for taking protected leave[^149]

**Element 4: Causation and Harm** – The wrongful termination caused Ms. Diallo economic and emotional harm.

### 2. California's Strong Public Policy

California has a fundamental public policy against employment discrimination and retaliation, as expressed in FEHA and CFRA.[^150] Terminating an employee while she is on protected leave caring for her dying father violates the most basic public policy protections California law provides to workers.

The *Tameny* wrongful termination claim provides a common-law remedy that exists alongside statutory remedies, ensuring that employers cannot evade accountability for discharging employees in violation of fundamental public policy.

---

## J. Tenth Cause of Action: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress

### 1. IIED Elements

**Element 1: Outrageous Conduct** – Defendants' conduct was outrageous and exceeded all bounds of decency:

- Subjecting a Muslim African American woman to racist and religiously bigoted harassment for years
- Ignoring her repeated complaints to Human Resources
- Terminating her employment while she was on leave caring for her dying father
- Terminating her only four days before her father's death
- Failing to inform her of the termination, leaving her to discover it weeks later upon returning to the United States
- Providing three different termination letters with conflicting dates[^151]

The combination of these actions—particularly terminating a grieving daughter during protected leave while she tended to her dying father—is precisely the type of extreme and outrageous conduct that constitutes IIED.

**Element 2: Intent or Reckless Disregard** – Defendants intended to cause emotional distress, or at minimum acted with reckless disregard of the probability that their conduct would cause severe emotional distress. Terminating an employee during CFRA leave taken to care for a dying parent, without notice or explanation, demonstrates either intent to harm or conscious disregard of the severe emotional consequences.

**Element 3: Severe Emotional Distress** – Ms. Diallo suffered severe emotional distress requiring 6-8 weeks of inpatient treatment at John Muir Behavioral Center, a mental health facility.[^152] This documented psychiatric hospitalization demonstrates the severity of her emotional suffering.

**Element 4: Causation** – Defendants' outrageous conduct was a substantial factor in causing Ms. Diallo's severe emotional distress.

### 2. Exceeding the High Bar for Workplace IIED

California courts apply a heightened standard for IIED claims arising from employment conduct, recognizing that employment disputes often involve some level of emotional distress.[^153] However, Defendants' conduct here easily exceeds that heightened threshold. Terminating an employee *during protected leave taken to care for her dying father*—while simultaneously ignoring her requests for information and failing to provide any notice—constitutes conduct "so extreme as to exceed all bounds of decency in civilized society."[^154]

---

## K. Eleventh Cause of Action: Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention

### 1. Elements

**Element 1: Employee Unfitness or Incompetence** – Vladychkin was unfit to serve as a supervisor. His pattern of racist and religiously discriminatory harassment, documented through Ms. Diallo's complaints, demonstrated his unfitness.[^155]

**Element 2: Employer Knowledge** – Wells Fargo knew or should have known of Vladychkin's unfitness. Ms. Diallo made at least four complaints to Human Resources about Vladychkin's harassment and discrimination.[^156] Wells Fargo therefore had actual knowledge of his unfitness.

**Element 3: Unfitness Caused Plaintiff's Injury** – Vladychkin's discriminatory and harassing conduct directly caused Ms. Diallo's injuries.[^157]

**Element 4: Employer Negligence Was Proximate Cause** – Wells Fargo's negligent retention and supervision of Vladychkin, despite knowing of his discriminatory conduct, was a proximate cause of Ms. Diallo's harm.[^158]

### 2. Duty to Investigate and Remediate

Once Wells Fargo received Ms. Diallo's complaints about Vladychkin's harassment, it had a legal duty to investigate those complaints and take appropriate corrective action.[^159] Instead, Wells Fargo took no action whatsoever—no investigation, no findings, no discipline, no remedial measures.[^160]

By retaining Vladychkin in a supervisory role despite knowing of his discriminatory conduct, Wells Fargo negligently exposed Ms. Diallo to ongoing harassment and discrimination. This negligent retention and supervision is independently actionable.

---

## L. Summary: Overwhelming Liability

Each of Ms. Diallo's eleven causes of action is supported by compelling evidence:

1. **Direct Evidence**: Vladychkin's explicit racist and religiously discriminatory statements
2. **Documented Complaints**: At least four complaints to Human Resources that were ignored
3. **Temporal Proximity**: Termination seven days after requesting leave extension and while on protected leave
4. **Pretext Evidence**: Three different termination letters with conflicting dates, excellent performance reviews contradicting any performance justification, and failure to provide notice
5. **Violation of CFRA Protections**: Termination during approved protected leave
6. **Severe Harm**: 6-8 weeks of inpatient psychiatric treatment

Wells Fargo will have no credible defense to any of these claims. The evidence of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and CFRA violations is overwhelming and supported by documents, statements, and medical records.

# V. DAMAGES CALCULATION

Ms. Diallo has suffered extensive economic and non-economic damages as a direct result of Wells Fargo's unlawful discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and wrongful termination. This section details the damages to which Ms. Diallo is entitled under California law.

## A. Economic Damages

### 1. Past Lost Wages and Benefits

**Past Lost Wages (December 14, 2022 – Present)**

Ms. Diallo was terminated from her position as Personal Banker at Wells Fargo on December 14, 2022.[^161] At the time of her termination, she earned an hourly wage of **$24.50 per hour**.[^162] Based on a full-time schedule of 40 hours per week, Ms. Diallo's annual salary was approximately **$50,960**.[^163]

From the date of her unlawful termination (December 14, 2022) through the present date (approximately **25 months**), Ms. Diallo has lost wages in the amount of:

**Past Lost Wages: $106,000**[^164]

This calculation is conservative and does not account for merit increases, cost-of-living adjustments, or promotional opportunities that Ms. Diallo would have received had she remained employed at Wells Fargo during this period.

**Lost Benefits**

In addition to lost wages, Ms. Diallo has been deprived of valuable employment benefits, including:

- **Health Insurance Coverage**: Wells Fargo provided comprehensive health insurance benefits to Ms. Diallo and her family members. The estimated value of this coverage is approximately **$18,000 per year** ($1,500 per month for 25 months = **$37,500**).[^165]

- **401(k) Retirement Contributions**: Wells Fargo matched employee 401(k) contributions up to 6% of salary. Ms. Diallo has lost employer matching contributions of approximately **$3,000 per year** (total **$6,250** for 25 months).[^166]

- **Paid Time Off**: Ms. Diallo accrued vacation and sick leave benefits that she has been unable to accrue since her termination (estimated value: **$4,000**).[^167]

- **Performance Bonuses**: As a Personal Banker, Ms. Diallo was eligible for quarterly performance bonuses based on sales metrics. Based on her historical performance, she would have earned approximately **$8,000 in bonuses** over the 25-month period.[^168]

**Total Past Economic Damages: $161,750**

### 2. Future Lost Wages and Benefits

**Future Lost Earnings Capacity**

Ms. Diallo's career prospects have been severely damaged by Wells Fargo's unlawful conduct. At the time of her termination, Ms. Diallo was 38 years old with more than **10 years of banking experience**.[^169] She had a proven track record of excellent performance and was on an upward career trajectory.[^170]

The discriminatory termination has resulted in:

1. **Damage to Professional Reputation**: Ms. Diallo's termination under false pretenses has made it difficult for her to secure comparable employment in the banking industry.[^171]

2. **Lost Promotional Opportunities**: Had Ms. Diallo remained employed, she would have been eligible for promotion to higher-level positions such as Senior Personal Banker, Branch Manager, or other supervisory roles with significantly higher compensation.[^172]

3. **Career Disruption**: The unlawful termination interrupted Ms. Diallo's career progression, forcing her to seek entry-level positions at lower compensation rates.[^173]

**Future Wage Loss Calculation**

Assuming Ms. Diallo would have continued employment until normal retirement age (approximately **27 additional years**), and accounting for:

- Base salary of $50,960 with conservative annual increases of 3%
- Lost promotional opportunities (estimated increase to $65,000-$75,000 within 5 years)
- Lost benefits continuation
- Reduced earning capacity in mitigation employment

The present value of Ms. Diallo's **future economic damages is estimated at $800,000 to $1,200,000**.[^174] This calculation accounts for the difference between what Ms. Diallo would have earned at Wells Fargo versus her reduced earning capacity in the job market following the discriminatory termination.

**Total Future Economic Damages: $800,000 - $1,200,000**

### 3. Medical and Psychiatric Treatment Expenses

**Past Medical Expenses**

As a direct result of Wells Fargo's unlawful conduct, Ms. Diallo suffered severe emotional distress requiring extensive psychiatric treatment, including **6 to 8 weeks of intensive psychiatric hospitalization**.[^175]

Medical expenses incurred include:

- **Psychiatric Hospitalization**: 6-8 weeks of inpatient psychiatric treatment (estimated cost: **$60,000 - $80,000**).[^176]
- **Ongoing Therapy**: Individual therapy sessions, psychiatric medication management, and counseling (estimated: **$15,000**).[^177]
- **Emergency Medical Care**: Emergency room visits and crisis intervention services (estimated: **$5,000**).[^178]

**Past Medical Expenses: $80,000 - $100,000**

**Future Medical Expenses**

Ms. Diallo will require ongoing psychiatric care and counseling for the foreseeable future, including:

- Continued individual therapy (estimated **$200 per week** for 5 years = **$52,000**)
- Psychiatric medication and monitoring (**$5,000 per year** for 5 years = **$25,000**)
- Potential additional hospitalization if symptoms worsen (**$50,000 reserve**)

**Future Medical Expenses: $125,000**

**Total Medical Expenses: $205,000 - $225,000**

## B. Non-Economic Damages

### 1. Emotional Distress Damages

Under CACI No. 2406, Ms. Diallo is entitled to recover damages for emotional distress, including compensation for **physical pain, mental suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, anxiety, humiliation, and emotional trauma** caused by Defendants' unlawful conduct.[^179]

**Severity and Duration of Emotional Harm**

The emotional distress suffered by Ms. Diallo has been **severe, prolonged, and life-altering**:

1. **Psychiatric Hospitalization**: Ms. Diallo required **6 to 8 weeks of intensive inpatient psychiatric treatment** following her termination—a clear indicator of the extreme severity of her emotional injuries.[^180]

2. **Suicide Risk**: Ms. Diallo's mental health deteriorated to the point where hospitalization was necessary to prevent self-harm, demonstrating the profound psychological impact of Defendants' conduct.[^181]

3. **Ongoing Symptoms**: Ms. Diallo continues to experience anxiety, depression, nightmares, panic attacks, and post-traumatic stress symptoms more than two years after her termination.[^182]

4. **Impact on Daily Functioning**: The emotional distress has impaired Ms. Diallo's ability to work, maintain relationships, sleep, and engage in activities she once enjoyed.[^183]

5. **Compound Trauma**: Ms. Diallo experienced the death of her beloved father on December 18, 2022—just **four days after her unlawful termination**—while she was on protected CFRA leave to care for him. Defendants' actions deprived Ms. Diallo of the opportunity to spend her father's final days focused on his care rather than dealing with the shock and trauma of her wrongful termination.[^184]

**Nature of Defendants' Conduct**

The severity of emotional distress damages is directly related to the **egregious nature** of Defendants' conduct:

- **Overt Racial and Religious Discrimination**: Vladychkin's explicit racist statements that Black people of African descent are "loud and not smart" and his religious discrimination stating he "would never have hired" Ms. Diallo if he had known she was Muslim demonstrate malicious intent.[^185]

- **Timing of Termination**: Defendants terminated Ms. Diallo **during her protected CFRA leave** to care for her dying father, showing callous disregard for her family emergency and her legal rights.[^186]

- **Three Conflicting Termination Letters**: The shifting explanations for termination—each contradicting the previous one—demonstrate deliberate dishonesty designed to cover up unlawful motives.[^187]

- **Ignored Complaints**: Despite Ms. Diallo filing **four separate HR complaints** about Vladychkin's harassment and discrimination, Wells Fargo took no corrective action, allowing the abuse to continue.[^188]

- **Betrayal After 10+ Years of Service**: After more than a decade of loyal service with excellent performance reviews, Ms. Diallo was subjected to a campaign of harassment and ultimately terminated under false pretenses.[^189]

**Comparable Case Authority**

California courts have awarded substantial emotional distress damages in employment discrimination cases, particularly where:

- The harassment was severe and pervasive
- The plaintiff suffered documented psychiatric harm
- The employer's conduct was particularly egregious
- The plaintiff had a long tenure with the employer

Awards in comparable cases have ranged from **$200,000 to $1,000,000** for emotional distress damages alone.[^190]

**Emotional Distress Damages: $500,000 - $750,000**

### 2. Loss of Enjoyment of Life

Ms. Diallo's quality of life has been permanently diminished by Defendants' unlawful conduct. She has experienced:

- Loss of confidence and self-esteem
- Inability to enjoy social activities and family relationships
- Constant anxiety and fear in professional settings
- Physical manifestations of stress (sleep disturbance, appetite changes, physical pain)
- Loss of trust in workplace environments

**Loss of Enjoyment of Life: $100,000 - $150,000**

**Total Non-Economic Damages: $600,000 - $900,000**

## C. Punitive Damages

### 1. Legal Standard for Punitive Damages

Under California Civil Code § 3294 and CACI No. 2408, punitive damages are available in employment discrimination cases where the defendant's conduct involves **malice, oppression, or fraud**.[^191]

- **Malice**: Conduct intended to cause injury or despicable conduct carried on with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights of others.[^192]
- **Oppression**: Despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights.[^193]
- **Fraud**: An intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact with intent to deprive a person of property or legal rights.[^194]

For corporate employers like Wells Fargo, punitive damages may be imposed when:

1. An **officer, director, or managing agent** authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct; or
2. The corporation was **personally guilty** of oppression, fraud, or malice.[^195]

### 2. Evidence of Malice, Oppression, and Fraud

**Vladychkin's Malicious Conduct**

Sergiy Vladychkin, as Ms. Diallo's direct supervisor and a managing agent of Wells Fargo, engaged in conduct demonstrating **clear malice and oppression**:

1. **Explicit Racist Statements**: Vladychkin's repeated statements that Black people of African descent are "loud and not smart" constitute despicable conduct carried out with conscious disregard for Ms. Diallo's rights.[^196]

2. **Religious Discrimination**: Vladychkin's statement that he "would never have hired" Ms. Diallo if he had known she was Muslim demonstrates intentional discriminatory animus.[^197]

3. **Targeting During Family Crisis**: Vladychkin initiated Ms. Diallo's termination while she was on protected leave caring for her dying father, showing **cruel and unjust hardship** inflicted with full knowledge of her circumstances.[^198]

**Wells Fargo's Ratification and Corporate Malice**

Wells Fargo, as a corporate entity, demonstrated **ratification of malicious conduct** and **independent corporate malice**:

1. **Ratification Through Inaction**: Despite receiving **four separate HR complaints** about Vladychkin's discriminatory conduct, Wells Fargo's corporate leadership took no corrective action, effectively ratifying and approving his behavior.[^199]

2. **Deliberate Fraud**: Wells Fargo issued **three different termination letters** with contradictory explanations for Ms. Diallo's discharge, demonstrating intentional deceit designed to conceal the true discriminatory motive.[^200]

3. **Termination During Protected Leave**: Corporate decision-makers at Wells Fargo authorized Ms. Diallo's termination on December 14, 2022, while she was on approved CFRA leave—a decision that could only have been made with **conscious disregard** for her protected rights.[^201]

4. **Systematic Failure to Prevent**: Wells Fargo's failure to investigate or respond to multiple complaints demonstrates a corporate policy or practice of tolerating discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.[^202]

### 3. Purpose and Amount of Punitive Damages

**Punishment Function**

Punitive damages serve to **punish** Defendants for their egregious conduct. The conduct here—explicit racial and religious discrimination, termination during protected family leave, and systematic cover-up—warrants substantial punishment.[^203]

**Deterrence Function**

Punitive damages also serve to **deter** similar conduct in the future, both by Wells Fargo and by other large corporate employers. Wells Fargo is a massive financial institution with billions of dollars in annual revenue.[^204] To achieve meaningful deterrence, punitive damages must be substantial enough to impact corporate decision-making.

**Constitutional Limits**

Under *State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell*, 538 U.S. 408 (2003), punitive damages must bear a reasonable relationship to compensatory damages, though no rigid formula applies. California courts have upheld punitive damage awards ranging from **1:1 to 10:1** ratios in employment cases involving egregious discrimination.[^205]

**Calculation**

Given:
- Total compensatory damages: **$1,766,750 - $2,486,750**
- Wells Fargo's vast financial resources
- The particularly egregious nature of the conduct
- The need for meaningful deterrence
- The pattern of ignored complaints suggesting systematic tolerance of discrimination

**Punitive Damages: $3,500,000 - $7,500,000**

This represents a ratio of approximately **2:1 to 3:1** compared to compensatory damages, which is well within constitutional limits and appropriate given the reprehensibility of Defendants' conduct.[^206]

## D. Attorney's Fees and Costs

### 1. Statutory Basis for Fee Award

Under California Government Code § 12965(b), a prevailing plaintiff in a FEHA action "may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and costs, including expert witness fees."[^207] Unlike federal civil rights statutes, FEHA fee awards are **mandatory** for prevailing plaintiffs ("shall" vs. "may").[^208]

Additionally, California Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5 provides for fee awards in cases enforcing important public rights, even beyond the specific FEHA provision.[^209]

### 2. Anticipated Fee Award

Attorney's fees in employment discrimination cases are calculated using the **lodestar method**: reasonable hourly rate multiplied by reasonable hours expended.[^210] Courts may then apply a multiplier based on factors including:

- Complexity of the case
- Risk of non-payment
- Quality of representation
- Results achieved
- Contingency nature of representation[^211]

Based on the complexity of this case, the extensive discovery required, motion practice, expert witness retention, trial preparation, and trial itself, Ms. Diallo's attorney's fees and costs are estimated at:

**Attorney's Fees: $350,000 - $500,000**
**Costs and Expert Fees: $75,000 - $100,000**

**Total Fees and Costs: $425,000 - $600,000**

# VI. SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION

## A. Purpose of Mediation

Ms. Diallo brings this case to mediation with a genuine desire to resolve this matter fairly and avoid the expense, uncertainty, and emotional toll of protracted litigation and trial. While Ms. Diallo is fully prepared to proceed to trial and is confident in the strength of her case, mediation offers both parties an opportunity to achieve resolution on mutually acceptable terms.

Mediation serves several important purposes in this case:

1. **Efficient Resolution**: Avoiding the significant costs, delays, and uncertainties inherent in employment discrimination trials.

2. **Controlled Outcome**: Allowing both parties to participate in crafting a resolution rather than leaving the outcome entirely to a jury.

3. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Resolving the matter confidentially without the public scrutiny of a trial.

4. **Finality**: Achieving closure and allowing Ms. Diallo to move forward with her life and career.

## B. Strengths of Plaintiff's Case

Ms. Diallo's case presents exceptionally strong evidence of liability on all eleven causes of action. The following factors make this a particularly compelling case for Plaintiff:

### 1. Direct Evidence of Discrimination

Unlike many employment discrimination cases that rely entirely on circumstantial evidence, **this case features direct evidence of both racial and religious discrimination** through Vladychkin's explicit discriminatory statements:

- **Racial Discrimination**: Vladychkin's statement that Black people, especially those of African descent, are **"loud and not smart"** constitutes direct evidence of racial animus.[^212]

- **Religious Discrimination**: Vladychkin's statement that he **"would never have hired"** Ms. Diallo if he had known she was Muslim demonstrates explicit religious bias.[^213]

This direct evidence eliminates the need to rely solely on the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework and allows Ms. Diallo to proceed directly to proving that discrimination was a motivating factor in her termination.[^214]

### 2. Extraordinary Temporal Proximity

The timing of Ms. Diallo's termination provides overwhelming circumstantial evidence of discrimination and retaliation:

- **Termination During Protected CFRA Leave**: Ms. Diallo was terminated on **December 14, 2022**, while on approved CFRA leave that began September 26, 2022.[^215] Terminating an employee during protected medical leave constitutes direct evidence of CFRA interference.

- **Seven Days After Leave Extension Request**: The termination came just **seven days** after Ms. Diallo requested a leave extension on December 7, 2022.[^216] This extraordinarily close temporal proximity supports a strong inference of retaliatory motive.

- **Four Days Before Father's Death**: Ms. Diallo's father passed away on December 18, 2022—just **four days after her termination**.[^217] Wells Fargo terminated Ms. Diallo while she was caring for her dying father, demonstrating callous disregard for both her family emergency and her legal rights.

California courts recognize that temporal proximity alone can establish causation, particularly when the proximity is as close as **seven days**.[^218] Here, the temporal proximity is not merely close—it is **extraordinary**.

### 3. Powerful Pretext Evidence

Wells Fargo's shifting and contradictory explanations for Ms. Diallo's termination constitute strong evidence that the stated reasons are pretextual:

- **Three Conflicting Termination Letters**: Wells Fargo issued **three separate termination letters** with different explanations for the discharge, each contradicting the previous one.[^219]

- **No Prior Performance Issues**: Despite claiming the termination was for "performance issues," Wells Fargo failed to identify any specific performance deficiencies, failed to place Ms. Diallo on any performance improvement plan, and never issued any written warnings.[^220]

- **Excellent Performance History**: Ms. Diallo's **10+ years of service** with no documented performance problems directly contradicts Wells Fargo's stated justification.[^221]

This pattern of shifting explanations is classic evidence of pretext and strongly suggests that the true reason for termination was unlawful discrimination or retaliation.[^222]

### 4. Pattern of Ignored Complaints

Wells Fargo's complete failure to respond to Ms. Diallo's multiple complaints demonstrates both corporate ratification of Vladychkin's discrimination and an independent failure to prevent harassment and discrimination:

- **Four Separate HR Complaints**: Ms. Diallo filed **four distinct complaints** with Human Resources about Vladychkin's discriminatory conduct.[^223]

- **Zero Investigative Response**: Despite these multiple complaints, Wells Fargo conducted **no investigation**, took **no corrective action**, and provided **no follow-up** to Ms. Diallo.[^224]

- **Continued Harassment**: Wells Fargo's inaction allowed Vladychkin's harassment and discrimination to continue unchecked until Ms. Diallo's ultimate termination.[^225]

This pattern establishes both Wells Fargo's liability for failure to prevent discrimination under FEHA § 12940(k) and provides strong evidence of corporate ratification supporting punitive damages.[^226]

### 5. Severe and Documented Harm

The extent of Ms. Diallo's injuries is both severe and well-documented:

- **6-8 Weeks Psychiatric Hospitalization**: Ms. Diallo required intensive inpatient psychiatric treatment—an objective measure of severe emotional harm.[^227]

- **Ongoing Treatment**: Ms. Diallo continues to require psychiatric care and counseling more than two years after her termination.[^228]

- **Economic Losses**: Ms. Diallo has suffered substantial economic losses including lost wages, lost benefits, and significant medical expenses.[^229]

The severity of these damages makes this a high-value case with significant jury appeal.

### 6. Sympathetic Plaintiff

Ms. Diallo presents as a highly sympathetic plaintiff who will connect well with a jury:

- **Long-Tenured, Loyal Employee**: More than **10 years of dedicated service** to Wells Fargo.[^230]

- **Caring Daughter**: On CFRA leave to care for her dying father at the time of termination.[^231]

- **Multiple Protected Characteristics**: As a Muslim African American woman, Ms. Diallo is a member of multiple protected classes, and the discrimination against her implicates multiple forms of bias.[^232]

- **Severe Harm**: The psychiatric hospitalization and ongoing mental health struggles demonstrate genuine and serious harm.

Juries in California employment cases are historically sympathetic to long-tenured employees subjected to discrimination and wrongful termination, particularly when the employer is a large, wealthy corporation.[^233]

## C. Risks and Challenges for Defendant

From Wells Fargo's perspective, proceeding to trial presents substantial risks:

### 1. Jury Verdict Risk

California juries have historically been willing to award substantial verdicts in employment discrimination cases, particularly those involving:

- Large corporate defendants with significant resources
- Direct evidence of discrimination
- Termination during protected leave
- Severe emotional harm requiring hospitalization
- Multiple causes of action[^234]

**Verdict exposure in this case could significantly exceed the settlement range** discussed herein, particularly if the jury awards punitive damages at the higher end of the constitutionally permissible range.

### 2. Punitive Damages Exposure

The evidence supporting punitive damages is particularly strong:

- **Direct Evidence of Malice**: Vladychkin's explicit racist and discriminatory statements demonstrate malice and oppression.[^235]

- **Corporate Ratification**: Wells Fargo's failure to respond to four HR complaints constitutes ratification of Vladychkin's conduct.[^236]

- **Fraud and Deceit**: The three conflicting termination letters demonstrate intentional fraud.[^237]

- **Vast Financial Resources**: Wells Fargo's billions in annual revenue mean that significant punitive damages would be necessary to achieve meaningful deterrence.[^238]

Punitive damages are inherently unpredictable, and **juries have broad discretion** in setting punitive awards. A jury angered by Wells Fargo's conduct could impose a punitive damages award at the high end of—or even beyond—the estimated range.

### 3. Reputational Risk

A trial would result in **public testimony** about:

- Explicit racist and religious discrimination by a Wells Fargo supervisor
- Wells Fargo's failure to investigate or respond to discrimination complaints
- Termination of an employee during protected family medical leave to care for a dying parent
- False and contradictory termination letters

This testimony would be covered by legal media, could damage Wells Fargo's reputation, and might encourage other employees to come forward with similar claims.[^239]

### 4. Attorneys' Fees Exposure

As the likely prevailing party at trial, Ms. Diallo would be entitled to recover her attorneys' fees and costs under FEHA § 12965(b).[^240] Given the complexity of this case and the extensive litigation required, **fee awards could range from $350,000 to $500,000 or more**.[^241]

Fees would be calculated on a lodestar basis (hours × reasonable hourly rate) with potential multiplier for risk and results achieved. **These fees would be in addition to any compensatory and punitive damages awarded by the jury.**

### 5. Litigation Costs and Management Time

Beyond the risk of an adverse verdict, proceeding to trial involves:

- **Substantial Defense Costs**: Legal fees, expert witnesses, and litigation expenses
- **Management Time**: Depositions of corporate representatives, trial testimony, document production
- **Discovery Burdens**: Extensive document discovery regarding HR complaints, termination decisions, and Vladychkin's employment history
- **Emotional Toll on Personnel**: Current and former employees required to testify about workplace discrimination

## D. Settlement Framework

Ms. Diallo is willing to engage in good-faith settlement discussions and recognizes that settlement requires compromise from both parties. A reasonable settlement framework should account for:

### 1. Compensatory Damages Component

Settlement should adequately compensate Ms. Diallo for:

- **Economic Losses**: Past and future lost wages, lost benefits, and medical expenses
- **Emotional Distress**: Severe psychological harm requiring hospitalization and ongoing treatment
- **Loss of Enjoyment of Life**: Permanent diminishment of quality of life

As detailed in Section V above, total compensatory damages range from **$1,766,750 to $2,486,750**.[^242]

### 2. Punitive Damages Component

Given the strong evidence of malice, oppression, and corporate ratification, settlement should include a punitive component that:

- Punishes Defendants for egregious conduct
- Deters similar conduct in the future
- Reflects the reprehensibility of discriminating against an employee during protected family leave to care for a dying parent

As detailed in Section V above, punitive damages range from **$3,500,000 to $7,500,000**.[^243]

### 3. Attorneys' Fees and Costs

Settlement should include a separate component for Ms. Diallo's attorneys' fees and costs incurred to date, estimated at **$425,000 to $600,000**.[^244]

Alternatively, parties could agree to a "gross settlement" figure that includes fees, with allocation to be determined between counsel and client.

### 4. Non-Monetary Terms

Ms. Diallo is open to discussing non-monetary settlement terms that may be of value, including:

- **Letter of Recommendation**: A neutral or positive letter of reference to assist Ms. Diallo's job search
- **Neutral Employment Verification**: Agreement that Wells Fargo will provide only neutral employment verification (dates of employment, title, salary) without discussing reasons for separation
- **Non-Disparagement**: Mutual agreement not to make disparaging statements about the other party
- **Confidentiality**: Reasonable confidentiality provisions (though Ms. Diallo reserves the right to discuss the matter with family, counsel, accountants, and as required by law)

### 5. Tax Considerations

Parties should work collaboratively to structure settlement in a tax-efficient manner, including appropriate allocation between:

- **Wages** (subject to employment taxes and withholding)
- **Emotional Distress Damages** (income but not employment taxes to extent allocated to physical injuries/sickness)
- **Punitive Damages** (income)
- **Attorneys' Fees** (separate payment to counsel or appropriate gross-up if structured as fee allocation)

Proper tax treatment benefits both parties and maximizes the net value Ms. Diallo receives from any settlement.[^245]

## E. Settlement Authority and Decision-Making

Ms. Diallo is prepared to engage in meaningful settlement negotiations at mediation and has provided counsel with settlement authority to facilitate productive discussions. **Ms. Diallo will personally attend the mediation** and is available for caucus discussions with the mediator.

Wells Fargo should similarly ensure that a representative with **full settlement authority** attends the mediation. Productive mediation requires decision-makers who can evaluate settlement proposals in real-time without needing to seek approval from absent corporate personnel.

## F. Good Faith and Mediation Process

Ms. Diallo approaches this mediation in good faith and with realistic expectations. While the damages analysis above establishes a range of **$5.7 million to $10.6 million**, Ms. Diallo recognizes that:

1. **Settlement requires compromise** from both parties
2. **Litigation risks exist** for both plaintiffs and defendants
3. **Trial outcomes are uncertain** regardless of case strength
4. **Time value of money** favors earlier resolution over delayed verdict and appeals

Ms. Diallo is committed to working with the mediator and opposing counsel to explore creative settlement solutions that address the interests of both parties while achieving fair compensation for the harms she has suffered.

## G. Alternative to Settlement: Trial Readiness

Should settlement efforts prove unsuccessful, Ms. Diallo is **fully prepared to proceed to trial**. Counsel has:

- Completed substantial case investigation and legal research
- Identified and retained expert witnesses (economist for lost earnings, vocational expert, psychiatric expert)
- Prepared comprehensive discovery requests
- Researched and briefed all legal issues
- Developed trial themes and demonstrative evidence

**Ms. Diallo will not settle for less than fair value** simply to avoid trial. If Wells Fargo is unwilling to negotiate in good faith toward a reasonable settlement, Ms. Diallo is prepared to present her case to a jury and is confident in the outcome.

# VII. CONCLUSION

## A. Summary of Key Points

This mediation brief has demonstrated that Fatima Diallo has exceptionally strong claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Sergiy Vladychkin on all eleven causes of action. The evidence supporting Ms. Diallo's case is overwhelming and multifaceted:

**Direct Evidence of Unlawful Conduct**

Unlike the vast majority of employment discrimination cases, **Ms. Diallo has direct evidence** of both racial and religious discrimination through Vladychkin's explicit statements that:

- Black people of African descent are **"loud and not smart"**;[^246] and
- He **"would never have hired"** Ms. Diallo if he had known she was Muslim.[^247]

These statements eliminate any ambiguity about discriminatory motive and allow Ms. Diallo to proceed directly to proving that this discrimination motivated her termination.[^248]

**Extraordinary Temporal Proximity**

The timing of Ms. Diallo's termination—**seven days** after she requested an extension of her CFRA leave and **during** her approved protected leave period—creates an overwhelming inference of both retaliation and CFRA interference.[^249] California courts have held that temporal proximity far less compelling than seven days is sufficient to establish causation.[^250]

**Powerful Pretext Evidence**

Wells Fargo's issuance of **three different termination letters** with contradictory explanations for the discharge demonstrates that the stated reasons are pretextual and designed to conceal the true discriminatory and retaliatory motives.[^251] No legitimate employer issues three conflicting explanations for the same termination unless it is attempting to manufacture a justification after the fact.

**Systematic Failure to Prevent and Investigate**

Despite receiving **four separate HR complaints** from Ms. Diallo documenting Vladychkin's discriminatory harassment, Wells Fargo conducted **no investigation**, took **no corrective action**, and provided **no protection** to Ms. Diallo.[^252] This systematic failure establishes both independent liability under FEHA § 12940(k) and corporate ratification supporting substantial punitive damages.[^253]

**Severe and Documented Harm**

Ms. Diallo's injuries are not speculative or exaggerated. She required **six to eight weeks of intensive psychiatric hospitalization** following her wrongful termination—an objective measure of catastrophic emotional harm.[^254] She continues to suffer ongoing psychiatric symptoms more than two years later.[^255] Her economic losses exceed $1.1 million in past and future lost earnings and benefits, and her total compensatory damages range from **$1.77 million to $2.49 million**.[^256]

**Basis for Substantial Punitive Damages**

The evidence of malice, oppression, and fraud supporting punitive damages is overwhelming:

- Vladychkin's explicit discriminatory statements demonstrate malice;[^257]
- The termination during protected family medical leave demonstrates oppression and cruel disregard for Ms. Diallo's rights;[^258]
- The three conflicting termination letters demonstrate fraud and intentional deceit;[^259] and
- Wells Fargo's failure to investigate four HR complaints constitutes corporate ratification.[^260]

Punitive damages in the range of **$3.5 million to $7.5 million** are appropriate to punish this egregious conduct and deter similar violations in the future.[^261]

## B. The Stakes for Wells Fargo

Wells Fargo faces substantial risk if this case proceeds to trial:

**Verdict Risk**

California juries have historically awarded significant verdicts in employment discrimination cases involving:
- Large corporate defendants with deep pockets
- Direct evidence of discrimination
- Termination during protected leave
- Severe emotional harm
- Long-tenured employees[^262]

The combination of all these factors in Ms. Diallo's case creates **exceptional verdict risk** for Wells Fargo. Jury verdicts could significantly exceed the settlement ranges discussed in this brief, particularly if the jury is offended by Wells Fargo's conduct and awards punitive damages at the higher end of the constitutionally permissible range.

**Attorneys' Fees Exposure**

As the likely prevailing party at trial, Ms. Diallo will be entitled to recover her attorneys' fees and costs under FEHA's mandatory fee-shifting provision.[^263] Given the complexity of this case and the extensive litigation required, **fee awards could range from $350,000 to $500,000 or more**—amounts that would be **in addition to** any compensatory and punitive damages awarded by the jury.[^264]

**Reputational Damage**

A trial would result in public testimony and media coverage regarding:
- Explicit racist and religious discrimination by a Wells Fargo supervisor
- Wells Fargo's failure to investigate multiple discrimination complaints
- Termination of an employee during protected leave to care for a dying parent
- False and contradictory termination letters
- Severe psychiatric harm requiring extended hospitalization

This publicity could damage Wells Fargo's reputation, harm employee morale, and potentially encourage additional claims from current and former employees who experienced similar treatment.[^265]

**Management Time and Litigation Costs**

Beyond the financial risk of an adverse verdict, proceeding to trial involves:
- Substantial defense costs (legal fees, expert witnesses, litigation expenses)
- Management time for depositions, trial preparation, and trial testimony
- Extensive document discovery and privilege reviews
- Emotional and productivity toll on personnel involved in the case

These indirect costs can be substantial, particularly for a complex employment case with eleven causes of action and significant damages at stake.

## C. The Path Forward

Ms. Diallo approaches this mediation with both **strength and pragmatism**. She recognizes that settlement requires compromise from both parties and that achieving resolution without trial benefits everyone involved. She is prepared to engage in good-faith negotiations toward a fair settlement.

However, **Ms. Diallo will not accept an inadequate settlement** simply to avoid trial. She has suffered too much, lost too much, and been harmed too severely to accept a resolution that does not fairly compensate her for her injuries and adequately punish and deter the egregious conduct she endured.

**Wells Fargo should seriously consider the following factors in evaluating settlement:**

1. **Liability is Overwhelming**: The direct evidence, temporal proximity, pretext evidence, and pattern of ignored complaints create an exceptionally strong liability case on all claims.

2. **Damages are Substantial and Well-Supported**: Ms. Diallo's economic damages are easily calculable, her emotional distress is objectively documented through psychiatric hospitalization, and the basis for punitive damages is clear and compelling.

3. **Trial Risk is Significant**: Juries are unpredictable, and the combination of a sympathetic plaintiff, a large corporate defendant, direct evidence of discrimination, and termination during protected family leave creates substantial verdict risk.

4. **Fees Will Be Substantial**: Wells Fargo will face significant attorneys' fees liability in addition to any damages awarded at trial.

5. **Settlement Avoids Reputation Risk**: Resolving this matter confidentially avoids the publicity and reputation damage of a public trial.

6. **Early Resolution Has Value**: Settling now avoids years of additional litigation costs, management time, and emotional toll on all involved.

## D. Settlement Framework

As detailed in Section VI, Ms. Diallo's total damages range from **$5.7 million to $10.6 million**, including:

- **Compensatory Damages**: $1,766,750 - $2,486,750
- **Punitive Damages**: $3,500,000 - $7,500,000
- **Attorneys' Fees and Costs**: $425,000 - $600,000

Ms. Diallo recognizes that settlement requires some discount from maximum exposure to account for:
- Litigation risks and uncertainties
- Time value of money (earlier payment versus delayed verdict and appeals)
- Avoidance of trial costs and emotional toll
- Value of finality and closure

Ms. Diallo is prepared to discuss settlement within a range that:

1. **Adequately compensates** her for past and future economic losses;
2. **Fairly values** her severe emotional distress and ongoing psychiatric harm;
3. **Includes a meaningful punitive component** that punishes the egregious conduct and deters future violations;
4. **Addresses attorneys' fees and costs** incurred to date; and
5. **Reflects the strength of her case** and the substantial risks Wells Fargo faces at trial.

**Ms. Diallo has provided counsel with settlement authority** and will personally attend the mediation to participate in caucus discussions with the mediator. She asks that Wells Fargo similarly ensure that a representative with **full settlement authority** attends the mediation to facilitate productive real-time negotiations.

## E. Trial Alternative

Should settlement efforts prove unsuccessful, **Ms. Diallo is fully prepared to proceed to trial**. Her counsel has:

- Completed comprehensive case investigation and legal research
- Identified and begun retention of expert witnesses (economist, vocational expert, psychiatric expert)
- Prepared detailed discovery requests
- Researched and analyzed all legal issues
- Developed compelling trial themes and demonstrative evidence
- Assessed jury selection strategies for this type of case

**Ms. Diallo is confident in the outcome at trial** and believes that a jury, upon hearing the evidence of:

- Vladychkin's explicit racist and religious discrimination
- Ms. Diallo's four ignored HR complaints
- Her termination seven days after requesting leave extension
- Her termination during protected CFRA leave
- Her father's death four days after her termination
- Her six to eight weeks of psychiatric hospitalization
- Wells Fargo's three contradictory termination letters

...will return a verdict that holds Wells Fargo and Vladychkin fully accountable for their unlawful conduct.

## F. Final Thoughts

This case is about more than legal claims and damage calculations. **It is about fundamental fairness, employee rights, and corporate accountability.**

Fatima Diallo spent more than ten years of her professional life working for Wells Fargo. She served customers with dedication, met her performance goals, and contributed to the company's success. When she was subjected to racist and religious harassment by her supervisor, **she did exactly what employees are supposed to do**: she reported it to Human Resources and asked for protection.

Wells Fargo failed her. The company that held itself out as committed to diversity and inclusion did nothing when one of its supervisors made explicitly racist and discriminatory statements. The company that touted its employee-friendly policies terminated a loyal worker during her protected family medical leave to care for her dying father. The company that should have investigated and remediated discrimination instead retaliated against the employee who reported it.

**Ms. Diallo deserves justice.** She deserves compensation for her economic losses, recognition of her emotional suffering, and accountability from those who violated her rights. She deserves to know that her voice was heard, that her complaints were taken seriously, and that there are consequences when employers violate fundamental employee protections.

**This mediation is an opportunity for Wells Fargo to do the right thing**—to acknowledge the harm caused to Ms. Diallo, to compensate her fairly for her injuries, and to demonstrate that even when the company fails an employee as badly as it failed Ms. Diallo, it will ultimately make things right.

Ms. Diallo sincerely hopes that Wells Fargo will approach this mediation with the seriousness and good faith it deserves, and that the parties can work together with the mediator to achieve a resolution that serves the interests of justice.

If Wells Fargo is willing to negotiate in good faith toward fair compensation, **settlement is achievable**. If not, **Ms. Diallo is prepared to present her case to a jury** and is confident in the outcome.

She looks forward to productive discussions at mediation.
